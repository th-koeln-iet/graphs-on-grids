# Welcome to Graphs on Grids

**Graphs on Grids** is a high-level framework for working with graph data based on Tensorflow 2.
It mainly provides specialized layers for graph data but also enables an easy workflow using its preprocessing pipeline.

For more information on the usage, check the provided [workflow guide](/usage/workflow).
Additionally, you can find documentation on the different layer types under the _layers_ section.

The framework mainly focuses on node-level tasks such as node regression or classification. For this, the framework 
provides tools to model standard as well as graph time-series problems.
